*What's happening in the world while PEOTUS tweets?*

The President-Elect loves to tweet--perhaps (ok, definitely) a little too much.  There is a school of thought that says
  his tweets are strategically timed to manipulate news cycles that are unfavorable to him.
  Let's test this hypothesis with data.

The [Phoenix Data Project](http://phoenixdata.org/) publishes data from thousands of Political Events each day,
coded to a uniform standard.  Donald Trump's twitter feed publishes dozens of incoherent ramblings each day.  Let's
 cross-correlate the two and explore the relationship between his more incendiary tweets and negative news stories.

## Todo:
 - Create a pipeline to digest Phoenix data and tweets
 - Identify incendiary tweets (# of retweets?  retweets by prominent news outlets?)
 - What world events are happening during tweetstorms?  Would they generate good or bad coverage for PEOTUS?
 - Automate and deploy!
