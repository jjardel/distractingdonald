*What's happening in the world while PEOTUS tweets?*

The President-Elect loves to tweet--perhaps (ok, definitely) a little too much.  There is a school of thought that says
  his tweets are strategically timed to manipulate news cycles that are unfavorable to him.
  Let's test this hypothesis with data.

We can compare Trump's Twitter feed to the feeds of major news outlets (AP, Reuters, etc) and see what's happening in
  the world while PEOTUS goes on twitter rampages.  Are major events happening that he's trying to distract us from?

## Todo:
 - Create a pipeline to digest tweets
 - Identify incendiary tweets (# of retweets?  retweets by prominent news outlets?)
 - What world events are happening during tweetstorms?  Would they generate good or bad coverage for PEOTUS?
 - Automate and deploy!
